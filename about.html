 <p>I'm currently the Web Content Specialist for Geographic Solutions, which designs, develops, and maintains web-based systems for the workforce development and unemployment insurance industries. I create and manage the web content and online help text for our clientâ€™s websites, working in a database environment across multiple servers.</p>
	<p>I began in print journalism, and now find myself coding. I have more than 15 years of experience producing written materials, including newspaper articles, press releases, newsletters, web content, corporate brochures and educational materials.</p>
	<p>My career has the common thread of working for companies that help people in some way, whether those people are job seekers, hospice caregivers (and by extension, their patients), or the local community-at-large.</p>
	<p>I like problem solving and using that knowledge to teach other people. I often find clients are eager to learn why things work (or don't), and often hear the response "I love learning about this."</p>
	<p>When I'm not working on personal website projects, I spend my time relaxing near the water, or trying out one of the many restaurants in the Tampa Bay area.</p>
