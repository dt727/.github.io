		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>I'm currently the Web Content Specialist for Geographic Solutions, a recent <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/bright-house-recognizes-regional-businesses/2265223" target='_blank'> regional business award winner</a>, where I create and manage the web content and online help text for our clients in the Workforce Development industry.</p>
		<p>I began in print journalism, and now find myself in code. I have more than 15 years of experience producing written materials, including newspaper articles, press releases, newsletters, web content, corporate brochures and educational materials.</p>
		<p>Although not "single track", my career does have the common thread of working for companies that help people, whether those people are job seekers, hospice caregivers (and by extension, their patients), or the commmunity-at-large.</p>
		<p>I like problem solving and using that knowledge to teach other people. I often find clients are eager to learn why things work (or don't), and often hear the response "I love learning about this."</p>
		<p>When I'm not working on personal website projects, you can find me on the weekend being close to the water, either exercising or lazing about.</p>
		<p><strong>Skills</strong>: CSS, HTML5, Powershell, SQL, InDesign</p>
		<p>If you'd like to follow me on Twitter, my username is <a href="http://twitter.com/darylt727">@Darylt727</a>.</p>
